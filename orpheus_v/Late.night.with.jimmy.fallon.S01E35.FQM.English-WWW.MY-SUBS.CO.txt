Welcome to  late night with

                    
Jimmy Fallon,  everybody.

                     
Let's get right to the news

                     
here.

                     
I read this.

                     
This is not good.

                     
I read that some teenagers are

                     
getting pregnant on purpose so

                     
they can audition for MTV's show

                     
    and pregnant. 

                     
Isn't that unbelievable?

                     
Not only that, I heard that some

                     
adults are running for president

                     
on purpose so they can audition

                     
for a show about killing moose.

                     
I read about this.

                     
Hey, this is huge.

                     
President Obama has reached a

                    
deal with Republicans to extend

                     
the bush tax cuts in exchange

                     
for extending jobless benefits.

                     
The Republicans in congress say

                     
they're thrilled with the tax

                     
cuts, while democrats leaving

                    
congress say they're thrilled

                     
with the jobless benefits.

                     
That's just the way it works

                     
out.

                     
I'm not sure what to think of

                     
this.

                     
A new study found that one-third

                     
of men between the ages of

                     
   and    are still sexually

                     
active.

                     
The survey had two boxes...

                     
 yes  and  please say no. 

                     
Just, come on, you know.

                     
Check this out.

                   
A woman in the u.K. Called

                     
police to report someone stole

                     
her snowman.

                     
Police have released this sketch

                     
of the suspect.

                     
This is pretty crazy.

                     
A man in Canada just moved out

                     
of his college dorm after living

                     
there for    years.

                     
You could tell he was getting

                     
old.

                     
When he puts a sock on the

                     
doorknob, that means he's

                     
getting a prostate exam.

                     
 Don't bother me, eh. 

                     
Get me some Mac and cheese.

                     
 Shut the door. 

                     
I just saw this.

                     
A woman in California just

                     
published a medical marijuana

                     
cookbook.

                     
Yeah.

                     
'Cause if there's one thing

                     
stoners are great at, it's

                     
following directions.

                     
Step one.

                     
Melt butter.

                     
Melt, melt... tuna melt.

                    
Maybe we should get some tuna

                     
melts and just smoke this pot

                     
and eat tuna melts.

                     
Bake at    .

                     
Very nice.

                     
Bake at     for    minutes?

                     
Yeah.

                     
Hey, the department of

                     
homeland security is bringing

                     
the  if you see something, say

                     
something  campaign to Walmart,

                     
reminding shoppers to report

                     
suspicious activity.

                     
I'm sorry, you want me to notice

                     
if there's any suspicious

                     
activity at a Walmart?

                    
You mean the place where I can

                     
go to one aisle and get a rifle,

                     
an iPod and some sunny  d ?

                     
Yeah, I'll let you know if

                     
there's anything weird happening

                    
there.

                     
Anything's possible.

                     
Yeah, I'll let you know.

                     
Nothing weird.

                     
Get this.

                    
Justin Bieber said that his mom

                     
recently canceled his cell phone

                     
plan after they had an argument.

                     
Yeah, his mom was like,  Justin,

                     
you will follow my rules as long

                     
 as I'm living under your roof. 

                     
You...

                     
Hey, police in London are

                     
looking for thieves who stole a

                     
$  million stradivarius violin

                     
from a musician while she was

                     
eating a sandwich.

                     
When asked to describe it, the

                     
woman was like,  I don't know,

                     
turkey, mayo, some tomatoes. 

                     
 Why does that matter? 

                     
That one's for Frank Drebin.

                     
Yeah.

                     
He would have liked that joke.

                     
And finally, I don't know if you

                     
saw this.

                    
A Chinese passenger train just

                     
broke a record by hitting

                     
    miles per hour.

                     
Yeah, passengers called it a

                     
thrilling experience, while the

                     
guy in the bathroom called it

                     
the worst day of my life.

Kermit Ruffins sitting in with

 Treme. 

                     
Here's his new album,  happy

Thanks for being here, Kermit.

                     
I appreciate it, buddy.

                    
Oh, thank you, man.

                     
Looking good, buddy.

                     
Looking good.

                     
That sounded great.

                     
We've got something over here

                     
too, as well.

                    
Look at this.

                     
It's the new issue of  rolling

                     
stone  magazine, right here, the

                     
playlist issue.

                    
Just came out.

                     
It's called the playlist issue,

                     
and right there in the inside,

                     
it's our very own questlove.

                     
There he is right there.

                     
Are you sleeping?

                     
What are you doing?

                     
Are you taking a nap?

                     
I think I'm sort

                    
of vibing out.

                     
You're vibing out.

                     
 Rolling stone  credits

                     
questlove with the idea for this

                     
issue.

                     
What is the playlist issue?

                     
You know,  rolling

                     
stone  is always asking, like,

                     
for your top ten favorite songs

                     
or whatever.

                     
And I told them, like,  why

                     
don't you do, like, the real

                     
 list? 

                     
You know, not just name all the

                    
Bob Dylan hits, but all the

                     
stuff that really defines an

                     
artist.

                     
So, they made that issue.

                     
That was awesome.

                    
And you got a lot of records,

                     
man.

                     
This was is in Philly, right?

                     
  ,  .

                     
  ,   records.

                     
That's why we

                     
haven't moved to New York just

                     
yet.

                     
You've got to wait...

                     
you got to wait... exactly.

                     
Well, congrats on this, man.

                     
Pick up this issue.

                     
It's a really cool issue.

                     
 Rolling stone. 

                     
Good man, quest.

                     
You're a good man.

A lot of parents... a lot of

                     
parents are taking their kids to

                     
see Santa at the mall right now.

                     
It's a big part of Christmas.

                    
So let's take a look at the pros

                     
and cons of being a mall Santa.

                     
Here we go.

                    
Pro... you get to wear a cool

                     
red suit.

                     
Con... it still smells like the

                     
dude who wore it last year.

                     
Yeah, that's not good.

                     
That's not good.

                     
Pro... being a mall Santa is a

                     
big responsibility.

                     
Con... this time last year, you

                     
were a vice president at

                     
citibank.

                     
Pro... you'll get hired if you

                     
work hard.

                     
Con... you'll get fired if you

                     
work  hard. 

                     
What does that mean?

                    
I don't know.

                     
Is that what the sound effect

                     
was for?

                     
You're fired.

                     
Pro... the warm

                     
feeling of kids snuggled on your

                     
lap.

                     
Con... the warm feeling of kids

                     
peeing down your leg.

                     
That's what Christmas is all

                     
about, isn't it?

                     
 $  an hour for this? 

                     
Pro... you get to hear kids ask

                     
where your reindeer are.

                     
Con... you'll have to explain

                     
that Sarah Palin shot them all.

                     
Why would you do that?

                     
You don't have to do that.

                     
You don't have to.

                     
Pro... your cheeks are

                     
like roses, your nose like a

                    
cherry.

                     
Con... you're drunk.

                     
You are...

                     
 Santa's got to get another four

                     
loko. 

                     
Pro... you get to work near

                     
frosty the snowman.

                     
Con... that's the name of the

                     
guy who deals cocaine by the

                     
dippin' dots stand.

                     
He's not a good

                     
fellow.

                     
Dippin' dots, the

                     
future of ice cream.

                     
Or  the ice cream of the

                     
future. 

                     
Yeah, yeah.

                     
Unless you're dealing with

                     
frosty.

                     
It's both, I guess,

                     
yeah.

                     
Pro... before your break, they

                     
put up a sign that says,  gone

                     
to feed the reindeer. 

                     
Con... after you've left, they

                     
put up another sign that says,

                     
 if you know what I mean. 

                    
What does that mean?

                     
I don't know what you

                     
mean.

                     
I don't know what it

                     
means, either.

                     
And finally, pro... ho, ho, ho.

                     
Con... that's Charlie sheen's

                     
Christmas list.

                     
There you go!

                     
That's the  pros and cons,

Sounding good, buddy.

week's  late night  hashtag, you

                     
guys.

                     
Today I went on Twitter and I

                     
started a hashtag called  keep

                     
your pants on. 

                     
For example, I tweeted out,

                     
 waiter at outback keeps asking 

                     
if I'm still working.

                     
I've got half a bloomin' onion

                     
left.

                     
 Keep your pants on! 

                     
So, this is where you guys come

                     
in.

                     
Go on Twitter.

                     
Tweet out something that makes

                     
someone want to tell someone,

                     
 hey, relax, keep your pants on,

                     
buddy. 

                     
Be sure to include the hashtag

                     
 keep your pants on. 

                     
I'll look at all of them and put

                     
some of my favorites on the show

So tune in.

                     
You might want to see your

Welcome to

                     
 competitive spit takes,  the

                     
game where we get audience

                     
members to tell a punch line to

                     
a joke, and their friends

                     
respond by spraying them with a

                     
mist of Luke-warm backwash.

                    
And then you, the audience,

                     
votes on which team performs the

                     
best.

Okay, good.

It still has not been decided

                     
who will be doing what.

                   
Does that make you nervous?

                     
No, not at all.

                     
It makes me nervous.

You guys know what a spit take

                     
is, right?

                     
Yeah.

                     
This is when someone

funny while you're drinking

 other serial killers. 

                     
Well, it's based on a book.

                     
The first season is based on a

                     
book.

                     
Okay.

                     
A book... the rights of which

                    
was purchased by independent

                    
producers who took it to

If you haven't seen the show, he

wrapping?

                     
That, I mean, a lot of that

                     
is taken from the book.

                    
As far as the specifics, we kind

                    
of fine tuned it and tweaked it

                     
and perfected it.

                     
And early on, I would be on set

just how he'd strap people down.

teacher or something.

                     
I think maybe next season

                     
we're going to do an all-musical

                     
episode of  Dexter. 

                     
You are not.

                     
No.

                    
You are not.

                     
No.

                     
Because  six feet

                     
under  was kind of dark as well.

                     
It was.

                     
I mean, yeah, in one way or

                     
another, I have managed to be

                     
surrounded by dead bodies...

                     
Yeah.

                    
Whether embalming them or

                     
making them...

                    
You're like...

                     
♪ I can sing ♪

                     
Yeah... I don't know.

                     
That didn't help

                     
anything, yeah.

                     
No.

                     
The season finale coming up.

                     
Yeah.

                     
I've got to say, with

                     
the way  Dexter  works is,

                     
you... oh, man.

                     
If you haven't seen this show,

                     
you've got get it on DVD, and

                     
you watch the whole thing.

                    
You don't know what's going to

                   
happen.

                     
The season finale is always a

                     
shocker.

                     
Right.

                     
And last season, oh,

                     
man, this is one of the best...

                     
I mean, John Lithgow was off the

                     
charts.

                     
Yes, he's insanely good.

                     
He was so great.

                    
Oh, man, you were both insane.

                     
It's like watching two great

                     
tennis people play tennis.

                     
They call them tennis people,

                     
right?

                     
Tennis... yeah.

                     
Tennis people?

                     
Players.

                     
Or players.

                     
Tennis people.

                     
People is good.

                     
Yeah... players.

                     
It was amazing.

                     
And then right before the finale

                     
aired...

                     
I didn't see it.

                     
I had it on TiVo.

                     
I came into work and my second

                     
producer Lepis comes in and he

                     
goes,  oh, my God, I can't

                     
believe it was so great. 

                     
And he says what happened.

                     
Spoiled it entirely for you.

                     
That ruined my month.

                     
Yeah.

                     
I didn't... to this

                     
day, I haven't watched it.

                     
You still haven't watched it?

                     
I'm upset about the

                     
whole thing.

                     
You're kidding.

                     
Yeah.

                     
I have it... I have it still on

                     
my TiVo.

                     
I think if you watched it, by

                     
the time you get to the end,

                     
you'll be so engrossed that

                     
you'll have forgotten that you

                     
know what's going to happen.

                     
I can't ruin it for

                     
anyone, but that was... I'm

                     
shocked from hearing what

                     
happened.

                     
Yeah.

                     
It was the most

                     
shocking...

                     
jaw-dropping.

                     
Jimmy ... Happenings on tv.

                     
Yeah, no, people were

                     
literally grabbing me by the

                     
shoulder...

                     
You murdered Sam and

                     
Diane.

                     
Yeah.

                     
No, I'm just kidding.

                     
A little  cheers  reference.

                     
Yeah.

                     
This season finale's

                     
got another shocker.

                     
Can you give us little hints and

                     
tricks into what's happening in

                     
this season finale?

                     
Someone will die.

                     
There you go!

                     
Yes.

                     
There you go.

                     
You guarantee it.

                     
I guarantee it.

                     
People will pay good

                     
money for that.

                     
Yeah.

                     
You have good guest

                     
stars on the show.

                     
Yeah.

                     
This year you have

                     
Julia stiles.

                     
Julia stiles.

                     
I love her.

                     
She's a great.

                     
She's gorgeous and a

                     
great actor.

                     
And Johnny Lee Miller.

                     
Johnny Lee Miller.

                     
I think that Johnny Lee Miller

                     
is probably going to die.

                     
I can't tell you.

                     
Well, that's what

                     
you're hoping.

                     
You're hoping...

                     
Peter weller is on the show

                     
this year.

                     
Peter weller... yeah,

                     
 Robocop. 

                     
Absolutely.

                     
We all know you can't

                     
kill  Robocop. 

                     
Well...

                     
He's half robot.

                     
Yeah.

                     
That's a hint?

                     
You can kill the human part.

                     
You can kill the human

                     
part.

                     
Not the  Robocop  part.

                    
Yeah, his right arm... still.

                     
We do have a clip of

                     
the finale.

                     
Would you like to set it up?

                    
I think I'm driving in a car,

                    
as is Johnny Lee Miller, and

                     
we're having a heated exchange.

                     
That's not very specific.

                     
Here's a hint.

                     
All right, let's look.

                     
Here's  Dexter, 

                     
Michael c. Hall.

                     
She really means a lot to

                    
you,

                     
doesn't she?

                     
Yes.

                     
Must be terrible going

                     
through this again.

                     
Losing your wife, the woman you

                     
loved, and now lumen.

                     
I imagine it seems to you like

                     
some kind of terrible curse.

                     
Think whatever you want.

                    
Just listen to me.

                     
I'll turn myself over to you.

                     
I appreciate the offer, but

                     
I'm afraid I must decline.

                     
Then tell me what you want!

                     
I have what I want.

                     
And the longer I stay on the

                    
phone, the better your chances

                     
of finding me.

                     
So this conversation's over.

                     
Jordan...

                    
tick, tick, tick, Dexter.

                     
That's the sound of Lumen's

                     
life running out.

                    
Ooh!

                     
Wow.

                     
I think he's going to

                     
get saran wrapped, myself.

                     
Yeah.

                     
Jordan should be careful.

                     
Here we go.

                     
That's what I'm talking about.

                     
More with Michael c. Hall when

                     
we come back, you guys.

                     
♪

                     
We're back with

                     
Michael c. Hall from  Dexter 

                     
right here.

                     
I have a great picture of you

                     
here.

                     
Is this from next season of

                     
 Dexter ?

                     
What is this?

                     
Holy moly!

                     
There you go, there.

                     
Hey!

                     
This is you in  cabaret ?

                     
Yeah, I played the emcee in

                     
 cabaret  on Broadway about

                     
  ,    years ago.

                     
Yeah, my God, this

                     
is...

                    
and you did an amazing job.

                     
Thank you.

                     
Did mom and dad come

                     
see this?

                    
Mom came.

                     
Mom came, and I didn't have a

                     
chance to warn her about...

                     
About the glittery

                     
nipples?

                     
About what she was gonna

                     
see.

                     
The first act ended with me

                     
revealing my ass in a pin spot

                     
to the audience, and I had a

                    
swastika painted on it.

                     
She was horrified.

                     
 My dreams have come

                     
true! 

                     
Yeah, yeah.

                     
So it's all been kind of been

                    
downhill from there.

                    
There's been shocking things

                     
she's seen since, but she

                     
doesn't have to be in the room

                     
now.

                     
Yeah, yeah.

                     
Now she's like,  you're a great

                     
serial killer.

                     
 This is fantastic! 

                    
Yeah.

                     
Yeah, in fact, my family... you

                     
know, I was doing  six feet

                     
under  and I was playing a gay

                     
character, and I, you know, had

                     
some love scenes that I did on

                     
that show.

                     
I would go home and they'd be

                     
like,  yeah, we've seen the

                     
show.

                     
We've seen the show.

                     
 It's good, it's good. 

                     
And I got home after doing

                     
 Dexter  and people were just,

                     
like, jumping out of their skin.

                    
They were, like, so much more

                     
comfortable with me killing

                     
people than kissing men.

                     
Isn't that weird?

                     
Yeah.

                     
Well, it's not that surprising,

                     
I guess.

                     
Sad.

                     
You did do a lot of

                     
singing here, and I was

                     
wondering if Dexter did have a

                     
good favorite holiday song,

                     
maybe?

                     
If Dexter had a favorite

                     
holiday song?

                     
Can you give us a

                     
taste of a little something,

                     
maybe?

                     
'Cause we're in the holiday

                     
spirit here.

                     
I would guess maybe  Santa

                    
claus is coming to town. 

                     
You know, there's something

                     
about those lyrics that I would

                     
imagine would resonate with him.

                     
I can imagine Harry singing it

                     
to Dexter when he was little.

                     
You know?

                    
Can you maybe give us

                    
a taste of that, please?

Hi!

                   
You look very pretty.

                    
Thank you for coming on the

                     
show.

                     
Thanks for having me, Jimmy.

                     
We've met a few times.

                    
Yes, we have.

                     
With your husband,

                     
very talented writer.

                     
My husband and your wife...

                    
Yes, work together.

                     
Work together quite a bit.

                     
I feel like they've worked

                     
together nonstop for years.

                     
They have.

                     
He wrote with his partner,  he's

                     
just not that into you. 

                     
And their very first movie

                     
was  never been kissed  with

                     
Nancy.

                     
That's right.

                     
So that was, like, ten years

                     
ago.

                     
Absolutely.

                     
Now, are you guys enjoying...

                     
are you in New York for the

                     
holiday or no?

                     
No, no, no.

                    
We're in L.A.

                     
I'm just here for the day.

                     
Just to see you.

                     
Hey, thank you so

                     
much.

                     
And then I'm going home to

                     
see my family.

                     
Yeah.

                     
Oh, I appreciate that.

                    
Did you get away or do anything

                     
while you have time off?

                     
Yeah.

                     
For Thanksgiving, we went,

                     
actually, my husband and I had

                     
our first, like, romantic

                     
getaway without our kid.

                     
And we went to Mexico for the

                     
weekend.

                     
That's nice.

                     
You would think.

                     
Well, no, it was nice.

                    
What happened?

                     
It was nice, but it was sort

                     
of, like, kind of a bad omen

                     
when at the airport... we

                     
dropped my kid off in Phoenix

                     
with her grandparents.

                     
And at the Phoenix airport, we

                     
saw this guy at     in the

                    
morning get into a fight with

                    
the chili's bartender, like, at

                     
chili's to go.

                     
This guy wearing, like, full-on

                     
tevas, cargo shorts, like,

                     
patagonia, and he just starts

                     
yelling,  you want a piece

                     
of me? 

                     
No!

                     
Which is, like, not something

                     
that you ever expect to see in

                    
real life.

                     
His reading glasses on his head,

                     
 you want a piece of me? 

                     
And the bartender at chili's to

                     
go was like,  no, no, I don't. 

                     
 Like, I absolutely do not want

                     
a piece of you. 

                     
He's like,  I am

                     
Michael c. Hall and I want a

                     
 drink! 

                     
No.

                     
It was intense.

                     
And then we get there, and we

                    
were staying at this place which

                     
looked really beautiful.

                     
We were with some friends.

                     
But you have to, like, you fly

                     
into Puerto Vallarta and then

                     
you drive for an hour and a

                     
half.

                     
And then you take a boat

                     
   minutes to, like, a secluded

                     
island in the jungle.

                    
Whoa.

                     
And so, you're really cut off

                    
from civilization.

                     
Remote, yeah.

                     
And your phone gets spotty

                     
reception.

                     
And as we're hiking up into the

                     
resort, I'm like,  guys, I have

                     
a bad feeling about this.

                    
I just think something's gonna

                     
 happen. 

                     
And the resort was kind of

                     
terrorized by a jaguar that

                    
weekend that we were there.

                     
I'm sorry.

                     
I'm so sorry.

                     
Yes.

                     
Terrorized by a

                     
jaguar?

                     
Yeah.

                     
Well, it's all open rooms.

                     
And there was a jaguar that had

                     
come down from the mountains,

                     
and it was in my friend's room.

                     
Okay.

                     
In the middle of the night.

                     
And the people at the resort

                     
were trying... this is true.

                     
This is a romantic

                     
getaway?

                     
Yes, our romantic getaway.

                     
And the people in the resort

                     
were trying to pass it off.

                     
They kept telling us it was just

                     
a Mexican raccoon.

                     
Which is so crazy.

                     
Does that even exist?

                     
Is that real?

                     
I don't think so!

                     
I don't think so!

                     
I think they're just... no.

                     
It was a jaguar.

                     
And so then, my friend switched

                     
rooms.

                     
And this Australian couple

                     
stayed there.

                     
And then, the guy was, like,

                     
super burly and covered in tats

                     
and, like, really a hardcore

                     
Australian dude.

                     
And the next morning, he woke up

                     
and he was like...

                     
 Chased a jaguar out of my room

                     
last night, broke a bottle. 

                     
And chased him, like, down the

                     
stairs, out of their open-air

                     
room.

                     
What is going on?

                     
I'm not kidding.

                    
He broke a bottle and

                     
attacked and showed the

                     
jaguar...

                     
it jumped over their bed and

                     
he, like, broke a bottle and

                     
chased after the jaguar.

                    
With a jagged bottle?

                    
I guess.

                     
That would be so not

                     
what I would do.

                     
I would pretend I'm dead while

                     
my wife would scream.

                     
 Don't talk to me!

                     
Don't talk to me! 

                     
You read the rules.

                     
There's a wild animal in here, I

                     
pretend I'm dead.

                     
And then my wife... we both have

                     
to have a pact.

                     
I've got to call her.

                    
I've got to talk to her tonight

                     
and make sure if there's ever a

                     
wild animal.

                     
I mean, what would you do?

                     
No one is doing anything.

                     
Who switched rooms?

                     
That would be the worst idea.

                     
My friend Irene.

                     
What do you mean?

                     
She switched rooms with the

                     
Australian.

                     
With the one that's

                     
already been attacked by the

                     
jaguar?

                     
She was the one that

                     
originally saw and heard the

                     
jaguar the night before.

                     
Switched rooms with the

                     
Australians, 'cause they're

                     
like,  we're not afraid, we're

                     
Australian! 

                     
They're tough people.

                     
They're tough people.

                     
They are.

                     
They are a tough people.

                     
And then, the jaguar got them,

                     
and then they were a little

                     
afraid.

                    
Yeah.

                     
Yeah, it was crazy.

                     
Oh, my gosh.

                     
Amazing.

                     
Well, thank you for that.

                     
I know you have  cougar town  is

remember you from your first tv

Look at the babies.

                     
Look at those babies!

                     
Look how well you've

                     
all done.

                     
I mean, a lot of familiar faces

                     
here, James Franco, Seth Rogen.

                     
Jason Segel right there.

                     
Linda Cardellini, John

                     
Francis daley, who's, like, the

                     
tiniest baby in that picture and

                     
now is like  ' tall.

                     
Yeah, Samm levine.

                     
Yeah.

                     
I mean, I feel like it's pretty

                     
crazy that everyone, like half

                     
of the cast, are basically

                     
running Hollywood right now.

                     
Like, the biggest comedy movie

                     
stars.

                     
Yeah, they are.

                     
It's super fun.

                     
That must have been a blast

                     
working on that.

                     
I was a big fan of the show.

                     
Yeah.

                     
It was a blast.

                     
It was such a great time.

                     
But we all still have a very,

                     
you know, fond remembrance of

                     
the time.

                     
We keep in touch, and I love my

                     
buddies.

                     
I'm so happy.

                     
That was like your

                     
freshman class.

                     
And now you're doing

                     
 Cougarton. 

                     
 Cougarton,  that's how we

                     
pronounce it!

                     
Is that right?

                     
Yes, the  Cougartons. 

                     
We should be best

                     
friends.

                     
Oh, we should.

                     
Cougarton.

                     
Yeah,  cougar town,  with

                    
Courtney Cox.

                     
It's a huge hit, and it's a

                    
super funny premise, but I love

                     
that... this is a quote from

                    
 the New York times. 

                     
They said, they called the

                     
show... they called you guys

                     
 vegan yoga babes at a spa

                     
getaway. 

                     
So strange, because never in

                   
my life have I been described as

                     
a  vegan yoga babe. 

                    
People are always like,  I like

                     
that there's a real girl on tv, 

                     
like...

                     
it's so strange, because their

                     
point, I guess, was that we

                     
booze a lot on the show, we

                     
drink a lot of red wine, but we

                     
always look like sort of dewy

                     
and wonderful.

                     
But we actually make a concerted

                     
effort, at least on my

                     
character's part, to make her

                     
look like a floozy.

                     
Like, we always, I'm always

                     
like,  and the lipstick should

                     
be a little bit smeared right

                     
 here. 

                     
So, I guess that's maybe the

                     
person from  the New York times 

                     
is not following the show as

                     
closely...

                     
As closely, yeah.

                     
Maybe they need to be.

                     
Was it... oh, my God,

                     
what's that character?

                     
That's old lady glamour,

                     
right there.

                     
I don't know who that is!

                     
Old lady glamour?

                     
But she's terrible and should

                    
never come back!

                    
We do have a clip of

                     
you being very funny on

                     
 cougar town. 

                     
I'm pretending to be in a

                     
sorority, yes.

                     
I overheard Kyle, that

                     
douchey

                     
sigma kai who is always wearing

                    
the Jester hat, say that he

                     
hooked up with missy here, even

                     
though he dates a kappa.

                     
Missy, did you?

                     
Laugh!

                     
She totally did.

                     
Laugh!

                     
But sisters, this is a real

                    
teaching moment.

                     
The only way not to be labeled a

                     
tramp is to not sleep with guys

                     
who talk so much.

                     
Laugh!

                     
No, Deborah, I'm dead
